# AgeVgerms
Age and longivity game, correlate age with germse 
by assuming that we lived to 36 years on average 2000 years back, and around 72 years now, also assuming that we had 100T germs 2000years 
ago, and now we only have around 10T, the program calculate the correlation based on log10, to estimate other input results and draw a 
scatter diagram to show the calculated results.
